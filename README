Tricklepost - Post an RSS/Atom feed your microblog

Tricklepost tries to mitigate the impedance mismatch between RSS/Atom
feeds and microblogs.  Some feeds have a really high volume of new
items and/or many items appear in the feed at one time.  If many new
items in a feed get posted at one time your microblog you may end up
with a "post flood," which can be super annoying to your microblog
subscribership.  Tricklepost lets you enter a delay to wait in between
posts to ensure only one new item gets posted to your microblog every
so often, which is much cooler.  It handles multiple feeds and microblog
accounts.
